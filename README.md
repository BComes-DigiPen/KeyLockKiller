# KeyLockKiller
A basic C# program which "locks" the states of the Caps, Num, and Scroll Lock keys by sending a simulated keypress to the system when their states change. Essentially, when the user presses Caps Lock, the program presses Caps Lock again, thus reverting the Caps Lock key's state to what it was before the user pressed the key.
 
This program is intended to be run in the background and is for those who never use or accidentally press Caps Lock.
